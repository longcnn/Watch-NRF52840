 * @note @ref TWI_ISSUE_STOP
 *
 * @param address Data transfer direction (LSB) / Slave address (7 MSBs).
 * @param data Pointer to data.
 * @param data_length Number of bytes to transfer.
 * @param issue_stop_condition If @ref TWI_ISSUE_STOP, STOP condition is issued before exiting function. If @ref TWI_DONT_ISSUE_STOP, STOP condition is not issued before exiting function. If transfer failed for any reason, STOP condition will be issued in any case.
 * @return
 * @retval true Data transfer succeeded without errors.
